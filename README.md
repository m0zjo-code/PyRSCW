PyRSCW is a python tool for decoding machine generated CW (morse code) transmissions from audio files. This tool was inspired and developed using the algorithms from the morse decoding software "RSCW" by PA3FWM ([RSCW](http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/rscw/)).

This library was originally written to decode the output from GQRX for decoding telemetry from the XW2 series of satellites launched by CAMSAT (the Chinese Amateur Satellite Group).

This software was developed for Python3.x and has only been tested on Python 3.6.7. It may work with other versions although this has not been tested yet.

## Dependencies
PyRSCW requires the following Python packages:
 - NumPy (tested with ver. 1.15.4)
 - SciPy (tested with ver. 1.2.0)
 - MatplotLib (tested with ver. 3.0.2)
 - wavio (tested with ver. 0.0.4)

These can all be installed using pip3 with the following command:
```
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib wavio
```

## Installation
To run this software, clone this [repo](https://github.com/m0zjo-code/Pyrscw) and install the dependencies above. That's it!
